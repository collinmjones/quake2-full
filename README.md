Welcome to Kingdom Quake 2! The mod inspired by the Kingdom Hearts series!

Here you will be able to fight a new wave of enemies while using the power of the Keyblade!

How to install this mod: Take folder labeled "mods" from this repo and within your steamapps folder in your file explorer paste the folder into the Quake2 folder in the commons folder.

Each tool in your arsenal will be attached to the 1-10 keys just as you would switch weapons when playing Quake 2 normally.

You will be able to move around like Sora in the Kingdom Hearts series of games through being able to hover, fly, dash around while attacking, having a burst of foward speed through the combat roll, and double jump!

As with any Kingdom Hearts game you will have your own compainions to aid you in battle with their usefulness being generally debatable.

Let your heart be your guiding key as it guides you through the world of Quake 2!
